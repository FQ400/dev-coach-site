      <description>As you might know, this blog is made using Hugo  with the minimal theme  . When a post is shared on Twitter, I like to have a nice post preview.

      <description>The following tweet inspired me to dig deeper and write down my findings. ðŸ˜Œ
It will also give you the uptime and load average numbers for the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes. That&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m using it for most of the time.
&amp;mdash; Mathias Lafeldt (@mlafeldt) September 22, 2020  I thought of using w as an alias. I can&amp;rsquo;t because it is a command.
The command shows what users are currently logged in and what they are doing.</description>

After changing some code in the submodule I realized working with a submodule is a bit inconvenient and I decided to remove it.</description>
