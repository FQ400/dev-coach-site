      <description>This blog is using Hugo with the minimal theme. I followed the README on how to integrate a theme into a Hugo site. It mentioned git submodules, so I added a submodule with the original repo URL.
I got comfortable with the ecosystem. So I wanted to adapt the theme to my needs, which led me to fork the theme repo.
After changing some code in the submodule I realized working with a submodule is a bit inconvenient and I decided to remove it.</description>
