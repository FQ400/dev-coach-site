# 0001 Using Architecture Decission Records (ADR)

Date: 01-04-2020

This is the template in [Documenting architecture decisions - Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).
You can use [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) for managing the ADR files.

This is based on this template: https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record/blob/master/adr_template_by_michael_nygard.md

The filename structures as the following: 
```
<number>-<short-title>.md

0001-Using-ADT.md
```

## Status

Accepted

Options: proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, ...

## Context

I read about ADR and want to try ADT to make my decissions reasonable.

## Decision

Use ADR.

## Consequences

I might think twice before make a decission, because I have to write it down.
Maybe it structures my thoughts on a project.
