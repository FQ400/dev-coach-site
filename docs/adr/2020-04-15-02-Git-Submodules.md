# Git Submodules

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Everytime I adapt the code of the theme (git submodule), I have to commit
the code in that repository. Additionally I have to commit that the sub module
has a new latest commit to the main repo.

## Decision

Remove the sub module and integrate the theme into the main repo.

## Consequences

Optimising the development workflow is a big plus.
