# Google Fonts

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Before going live I have to set up an imprint and a data privacy page.
Google Fonts need to be mentioned. For now I don't want to investigate what exactly needs to be put in that document.

## Decision

Remove Google Fonts from the page

## Consequences

Every vendor OS (Windows, Mac, Linux) has its own fonts.
When the websites uses system fonts it might looks different on Mac, Linux and Windows.
I think this is not a real downside, because the main purpose is sharing information instead of sharing design.

Here is a page about "safe" fonts: https://web.mit.edu/jmorzins/www/fonts.html

Without Google Fonts, the page loads faster.
I don't need to mention Google Fonts in the data privacy policy.
