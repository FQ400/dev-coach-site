Recently I was pairing with a less experienced developer, 
which was a great learning opportunity for me after I changed my point of view.
I had the impression that we are _slow_ and I started to become impatient.
That feeling wasn't a good one, and I didn't like me feeling this strain.
So I started analyzing what exactly slowed us down.

When I say _editor_ I mean any text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

I think the most important thing is to use your editor effectively.
And on the other hand, using your editor in ineffective ways costs a lot of time and hence money.

Here are common commands which are worth practicing as well as learning their shortcuts:

- Open a file in a project
  - with a known location
  - with an unknown location
  - with known class/function name but unknown file name
- Search the project
  - for the usage of a class/function
- Search the file
- Navigate inside a file
  - jump to the beginning
  - jump to the end
  - jump to line X
  - jump to the implementation or type definition and back
  - jump to closing brackets
- Navigate inside a line
  - jump to the beginning
  - jump to the end
- Move lines of code around

Becoming better in using shortcuts will increase your available brain power 
to solve the actual problem that you (and your pair) are working on, instead of fighting your editor.

In general, your editor should be your friend instead of an obstacle. Make it your friend by practicing.

It is like learning to drive a car: At the beginning, you have to think about which pedal does what,
which gear needs to be put in or how to park your car.
After having practised a lot, driving your car becomes intuitive,
and you can focus on the road and the traffic.

It is also fine to exchange your editor and try a different one, if you feel you become more productive.
Try to question the tools you are using and be open for new ones.

Happy coding!
